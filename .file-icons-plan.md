# File Type Icon Design Plan

## Research Summary
Based on VS Code, Devicon, and popular icon libraries, here's the comprehensive plan for file type icons:

## Icon Design Principles
- Size: 14x14px for small UI contexts
- Style: Simple, minimalist line icons
- Stroke width: 2px for clarity
- Colors: Use currentColor for flexibility
- Recognition: Each icon should be instantly recognizable

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with most common file types (top 15-20)
2. Use consistent stroke width (2px)
3. Test visibility at 14x14px size
4. Ensure each icon is unique and recognizable
5. Add fallback for unrecognized types
6. Support both extension and filename matching (e.g., "Dockerfile")

## Priority Order
1. Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS (most common web/scripting)
2. JSON, YAML, Markdown, TXT (data/config)
3. Dockerfile, .env, .gitignore (devops/config)
4. Images (PNG, JPG, SVG)
5. SQL, Excel/CSV (databases/data)
6. Less common languages as needed
